# What is CI/CD

CI is like a teamwork practice, it means that as soon as a developer writes some code, it gets combined with everyone else's work. This helps catch mistakes early and keeps everyone's code working together instead of waiting for release day where a lot of things can go wrong

CD is like a super-fast delivery service. It means that once code is ready, it automatically goes live for users to see. This keeps the software up-to-date and helps get new features to users quickly

# What is Jenkins

Open Source, automation software. It helps automate parts of the software development process, like building, testing, and deploying code

# Stages of Jenkis

- Checkout: Get the latest code from a version control system like Git.
- Build: Turn the code into a working program or application.
- Test: Check if the program works as expected and doesn't have any bugs.
- Deploy: Put the program in a place where users can use it.
- Notify: Tell the team if everything went well or if there were any problems.
